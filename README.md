# Moodstamp
#### _Conceptualised and coded by Chrissie_

A minigame which generates asks the user questions about how they're feeling, 
and uses their answers and some randomisation to create a representative piece of art. By turning feelings into visuals, this will hopefully help the user both have a bit of 
fun and to honestly reflect on their current feelings.

## How it works

1. The user is asked some questions in the terminal
2. The user gives answers to the questions
3. The program draws a picture in based on the answers in a new window
